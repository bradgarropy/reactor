# Weighter React

After creating a completely server side weight tracking app ([weighter](https://github.com/bradgarropy/weighter)), it was time to begin learning the multitude of front end javascript frameworks.

I decided to start with React, as it seemed to strike a balance between popularity and ease of use. Learning React was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Client side routing, JSX, ES6, component relationships, and webpack were all challenges for me. In the end, I was able to recreate the [weighter](https://github.com/bradgarropy/weighter) application using React on the front end, and [weighter-api](https://github.com/bradgarropy/weighter-api) for the backend.
